# IIITDMJ_Bot
IIITDMJ Bot is designed especially to answer queries regarding people and places in the institute. It is also capable of providing weather reports of the city where the college is (or any other city in the world really).
This project makes use of python and Django framework for the database of the institute. The bot uses voice recognition to read user prompts and answers about various locations and areas of the institute. The bot also uses has a separate beta feature of image generation which uses OpenAI API. Other features may be added in the future.
A virtual environment is recommended for running the program. The environment needs to be activated everytime the program runs.
A 'requirements.txt' file has been attached but may need further addition of libraries being used in the project. Since, Django is being used in the project server needs to run using ``` python manage.py runserver ``` in database\base.
