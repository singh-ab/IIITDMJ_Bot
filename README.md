A virtual environment is recommended for running the program. The environment needs to be activated everytime the program runs.
A 'requirements.txt' file has been attached but may need further addition of libraries being used in the project. Since, Django is being used in the project server needs to run using ``` python manage.py runserver ``` in database\base.
